This is three card poker checker!

I created a total of three classes Poker.java, WinnerChecker.java, and PlayerHand.java.
The Poker class contains the main method capable to extract input data and converting them into specific data types and providing those converted data types to other functions from other classes.

I created PlayerHand class, instance that create from this class contain valuable data which help to determine the winner. 
Cards of the current player data pass to the constructor when an instance is created. 
From the data that received the PlayerHand class called parseHand function which initialize all the crucial detail of cards that the player is holding, 
such as whether, cards that the player hold are flush, straight, pair, or three of a kind. 

I created WinnerChecker class which has all static functions that help determine the winner of the poker game.
